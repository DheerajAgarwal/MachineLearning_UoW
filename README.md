This repo houses my work for the machine learning specialization offered by University of Washington and made available on Coursera.

The course recommends to use `GraphLab` and `SFrames`, however I decided to use `scikit-learn`, `pandas` and other common open source packages to make it more relevant to real life. All the notebooks are solved using `Python 3.6`. Version information is available in Course 1, Week 1 notebooks.
