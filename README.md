# READ ME

This repo houses my work for the machine learning specialization offered by University of Washington and made available on Coursera.

The course recommends to use `GraphLab` and `SFrames`, however I decided to use `scikit-learn` anc `pandas` instead to make it more relevant to real life.


# Course 1

Contains Week 1 to 6 of work including all python notebooks.
